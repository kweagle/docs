  | <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honeypot" target="_blank">Honeypot</a> | A honeypot is a virtual server that you can deploy on your network. Honeypots can look like any other machine on the network, or they can be deployed to look like something an attacker could target. You can have a single honeypot or multiple honeypots, and you can deploy them straight out of Product. Honeypots lie in wait for "attacker" events to happen, such as a port scan or an attempted user authentication, which immediately sets off an alarm. If you deploy the Company Honeypot and enable the associated alerts in Product, you will be notified if such an activity occurs. Once attackers find an initial foothold in a network, their next step is typically to run a network scan to identify all the other assets in the network.<br><br>Includes Honey Users, Honey Files, Honey Credentials, and Honey Alerts<br><br> **What it powers:**<br>- Honeypot Access detection rule and investigations<br>- Honey User Authentication detection rule and investigations<br>- Honey File Accessed detection rule and investigations<br>- Local Honey Credential Privilege Escalation Attempt detection rule and investigations<br>- Remote Honey Credential Authentication Attempt detection rule and investigations<br>- Corresponding Honey Alert type investigations|

##  Days 1 - 15: Get Up and Running
Install Collectors, deploy Insight Agents, and set up core event sources so Product can begin collecting the right data to detect, investigate and respond to threats in your environment.

<details><summary>Install the Collector</summary>

  The Collector is the on-premises component of Product that either polls data or receives data from Event Sources and makes it available for Product to analyze. (An Event Source represents a single device that sends data in the form of logs to the Collector.)
  
  The Collector captures the data generated by your event sources, compresses the data, encrypts it, and pushes it up to the Insight Platform. The Insight Platform will then normalize, attribute, analyze, and present that data for search. 

  #### How to install

  Identify all the servers where event source data originates from. Many networks consolidate security and network administration tools and services in a data center or corporate office. This central location is an ideal place to deploy a Collector on a dedicated host.

 1. Review the <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/collector-requirements" target="_blank">Collector Requirements</a>. 
 2. Install collectors on network servers or virtual machines that meet the following requirements:
     * 4 CPU cores with 2GHz+ on each core
     * 8 GB RAM recommended
     * 60 GB+ available disk space
     * Configured with a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) such as idrcollector23.myorg.com 

 For detailed setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/collector-installation-and-deployment" target="_blank">Collector Installation and Deployment</a>.

  The Insight Agent enables Product to provide continuous endpoint detection and response, which is necessary for identifying the early signs of an attack. 
  
  The Insight Agent collects live system information – including basic asset identification information, running processes, and logs – from your assets and sends it to the Insight Platform for analysis. The data is then passed to Product, where it unlocks the vast library of attacker behavior and endpoint detection rules. Combined with network and user data, this helps you identify stealthy attacks for both your critical and remote assets across the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 
     
 #### How to deploy the Insight Agent

  Each Insight Agent only collects data from the endpoint on which it is installed. You must install the Agent on all assets you want Product to monitor. The Insight Agent can be installed directly on Windows, Linux, or Mac assets. 

  You can deploy the Insight Agent on your target assets using either a <a href="https://docs.Company.com/insight-agent/using-a-token/" target="_blank">token-based installer</a> or <a href="https://docs.Company.com/insight-agent/certificate-package-installation-method/" target="_blank">certificate package installer</a>. The token-based installer uses a token to download configuration files, whereas the certificate package installer provides a .zip file with the configuration files. 
  
  1. Decide which installer is best suited for your environment. 
  2. Read the <a href="https://docs.Company.com/insight-agent/download" target="_blank">steps to download the installer</a> and follow the instructions. 

</details>

<details><summary>Set up core event sources</summary>

 Product’s core event sources provide the most data in regards to user attribution. User attribution correlates endpoint activity to individual users, including what endpoint applications they use, and when. Attribution gives you a more complete image of your security posture, as user accounts are the most common targets for sophisticated attacks.

 Setup instructions for each event source can vary depending upon the technologies you use. 

  To take advantage of Product's detection rule capabilities, you must set up these event sources:

  <details><summary>LDAP</summary>

  **Required for:** Detection Rules and Legacy Detection Rules 

  Adding a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server allows Product to track the users, admins, and security groups contained in the domain and to link account activity with real users to identify privileged and service accounts.

  #### To add the LDAP event source:
  * Designate a <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/set-up-a-service-account" target="_blank">Service Account</a> with the correct permissions.
  * Open Port 636 (LDAPS) between the Collector and the LDAP server.

For detailed setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/ldap" target="_blank">LDAP</a>.

  </details>

  <details><summary>Active Directory</summary>

  **Required for:** Detection Rules and Legacy Detection Rules 

  Active Directory provides security logs from your domain controllers and authentication and administrative events for your domain users. Make sure that you add one Active Directory event source for each domain controller.

  #### To add the Active Directory event source:
  * Open ports 135, 139, and 445 between the Collector and Active Directory.
  * Designate a <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/set-up-a-service-account" target="_blank">Service Account</a> with the correct permissions.

  For detailed setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/active-directory" target="_blank">Active Directory</a>.

  </details>

  <details><summary>DHCP</summary>

  **Required for:** Legacy Detection Rules

  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) event logs provide IP lease information to correlate each IP address with its assigned host at the time of the event.

  #### To add the DHCP event source:

  Choose one of the following methods:
  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/microsoft-dhcp#microsoft-dhcp-servers-logs" target="_blank">Domain Admin Account</a>: Use this method if you want to collect logs using a Domain Admin account.
  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/microsoft-dhcp#configure-with-nxlog" target="_blank">NXLog</a>: Use this method if you don’t want to use a Domain Admin account to collect logs.
  
  </details>

  <details><summary>DNS</summary>

  **Required for:** Legacy Detection Rules

  Connecting DNS as an event source allows Product to track services, incidents, and threats found on your network. DNS logs gathered from a DNS event source provide more information about web traffic. DNS also provides greater visibility into destination URLs, which can be flagged in Account Visited Suspicious Link incidents.

  For instructions on how to configure DNS appliances with Product, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/dns" target="_blank">DNS</a>.

  </details>

  <details><summary>VPN</summary>

  **Required for:** Detection Rules and Legacy Detection Rules
  
  VPN logs provide visibility into users' remote network ingress activity and allow you to collect and verify information about user activity.

  For setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/vpn" target="_blank">VPN</a>.

  </details>

  <details><summary>Firewall</summary>

  **Required for:**  Detection Rules

  By introducing Firewall data, you allow Product to track visits to malicious domains or cloud services. More than simply collecting configuration logs and change logs, Product can automatically attribute connection events to the users and endpoints that are accessing such websites.

  We recommend you set up separate Firewall event sources for each Firewall type.


  #### To add a Firewall event source:

  Determine which Firewall event source(s) best suits your needs and follow the related configuration steps.

  For setup instructions for each type of Firewall event source, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/firewall" target="_blank">Firewall</a>.

## Days 16 - 45: Alert and Investigate
Dive into Product’s detection coverage! Explore detection rules, investigations, alerts, deception technology, and Log Search to see how all of these components work together. Start using Product's powerful query capabilities, and visualize your log data using dashboards.

<details><summary>Review your detection coverage</summary>

#### Product Detection Engines

Product's detection capability is powered by 3 detection engines – The detection rule engine, the legacy UBA engine, and the basic detection rule engine (formerly known as custom alerts). Let's take a look at each: 

  * **Detection rule engine:** The primary detection rule engine detects on a variety of user behaviors and attacker techniques. Each <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/modify-detection-rules" target="_blank"> detection rule</a> hunts for a unique attacker behavior or user behavior.
  * **Legacy UBA engine:** The legacy UBA engine is powered by built-in <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/modify-uba-detection-rules" target="_blank">legacy detection rules</a> that apply insight to the millions of network events your users generate every day. These rules detect compromised credentials, lateral movement, and other malicious behavior.
  * **Basic detection rules:** Product provides powerful detection capabilities, but there may be times when they do not cover all your requirements. The basic detection rules engine allows you to create <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules" target="_blank">custom alerting</a> rules to detect inactivity, patterns in data, or changes in data.

#### Detection Rules 

  Detection rules are the logic Product uses to detect threats using Company’s wide array of threat intelligence. When the logic of a detection rule matches an event, an alert is created. Certain alerts automatically trigger investigations – this behavior is defined in the detection rule logic. On the Detection Rules page, you will find 2 tabs of built-in detection rules:

  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules/#attacker-behavior-analytics-aba" target="_blank">Detection Rule Library</a>: The Detection Rule Library contains rules that detect on a variety of user behaviors and attacker techniques. You can see all detection rules and the number of detections over the last 30 days on the **Detection Rule Library** tab of the Detection Rules page. You can also view <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules#rule-logic" target="_blank">rule logic</a>, related <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules#threat-groups" target="_blank">Threat Groups</a> and <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules#mitre-attack" target="_blank">MITRE ATT&CK mapping</a>, and <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules#filter-aba-detection-rules" target="_blank">filter</a>, <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules#sort-aba-detection-rules" target="_blank">sort</a> and <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules#search" target="_blank">search</a> detection rules.
  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/detection-rules/#user-behavior-analytics-uba" target="_blank">Legacy Detection Rules</a>: Legacy Detection Rules run on Product's legacy User Behavior Analytics (UBA) engine. These rules apply insight to the millions of network events your users generate every day to detect compromised credentials, lateral movement, and other malicious behavior. To view legacy detection rules in Product, click Detection Rules in the left menu, and click the **Legacy Detection Rules** tab.

  All out-of-the-box detection rules can be tuned to suit your environment's needs:
  - <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/modify-detection-rules" target="_blank">Modify Detection Rules</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/modify-uba-detection-rules" target="_blank">Modify Legacy Detection Rules</a>

 #### Notable Events and Alerts that allow you to prioritize your response
  Every moment Product is running, it finds and collects thousands of threats from all the assets and endpoints it has visibility into. However, many activities set off alerts even though they are not high profile threats, causing unnecessary alarm and risking potential burnout for Security teams investigating these alerts.

  **Notable Events**<br>
  As a part of Product's legacy user behavior analytics (UBA), Product monitors and baselines each user's activity, establishing a pattern for which assets the user owns, which assets they access, their remote login location, and other activity. <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/notable-events" target="_blank">Notable Events</a> are the events that fall between expected behavior and alert-worthy behavior. It is expected that almost any network will experience a large number of notable events on any given day.

  
  When user activity triggers an alert that generates an investigation, related notable events are automatically added to Investigation Timeline. This helps analysts better contextualize the behavior without these notable events going completely unobserved, and ensures your security team isn’t overwhelmed with low fidelity alerts.

**Alerts**<br>
  Alerts arrive to you in the form of an email with an incident number and short description to inform you of notable events and suspicious behavior captured by Product. There are a few different types of alerts and alert settings available:

  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/uba-detections" target="_blank">Legacy detection rules</a>: Product has over 60 legacy detection rules that are generated by Product's legacy User Behavior Analytics detection engine.
  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules" target="_blank">Basic detection rules</a>: For detailed information on Product's basic detection rule capabilities, check out the configuration sections for <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#inactivity-detection-alerts" target="_blank">Log Inactivity Detection Rules</a>, <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#pattern-detection-alert" target="_blank">Log Pattern Detection Rules</a>, and <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#change-detection-alert" target="_blank">Log Change Detection Rules</a>.

</details>
<details><summary>Explore investigations</summary>
 
  Investigations are an aggregate of the applicable alert data in a single place and are closely tied to Detection Rules and Alerts. The Investigations page allows you to quickly search your active investigations and provides you with the context you need to effectively prioritize, sort, and respond to alerts. 

  ![Product Investigations Page Preview](/Product/images/investigations_page_preview.png)

 **Let's review the Investigations home screen:**
  1. Investigations are listed in order of priority -- **low**, **medium**, **high**, and **critical**. You can also sort them by date created and by most recent detection.
  2. **Filter** your investigations by their attributes.
  3. Select the **date range** of the investigations you want to explore.
  4. **Search** your investigations by investigation name, associated users, or associated assets.
  5. **Create** a new investigation.
  6. Toggle between **timeline** and **table** view for a detailed look into a specific investigation.
  7. Change the status of an investigation to **open**, **investigating**, or **closed**.

  See <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/investigations" target="_blank">Investigations</a> to learn more. 
 
</details>

<details><summary>Explore Log Search and Queries</summary>

  Your connected event sources and environment systems produce data in the form of raw **logs**. Log Search takes every log of raw, collected data and automatically sorts them into **log sets** for you. New log events are added to the existing log and grouped with other logs in the log set, based on when the log event was created.

  When data is ingested, repetitive activity is processed and combined into a single entry. The count of the repeated events are included in the combined entry, and other fields such as bytes transferred are summarized. To learn more about data deduplication, read [Collector Overview](doc:collector-overview#data-deduplication).
  
  #### Use queries to enrich alerts and investigations 
  You can search your logs to learn more about the incident in your environment that triggered the alert or the investigation. 

  Log Entry Query Language (LEQL) is used when building queries in Product. LEQL supports Regular Expressions (RegEx) and can be used when creating basic detection rule queries and dashboards.

  Log Search supports many Product capabilities:
  * Data ingestion
  * Detection
  * Basic detection rules
  * Dashboards and reporting
  * Compliance standards


  #### Build and save a query

  Product provides different ways to search your data, including RegEx, String, KeyValue, or Keyword searches. With LEQL, you can construct queries to extract the hidden data within your logs.

  LEQL follows SQL-style syntax and constructing a query is simple and intuitive. Product requires you to input a `where()` clause first (if your query requires one) and add subsequent clause(s) and function(s), such as `groupby()` or `calculate`, respectively.

  * `where ()` = search <br>
  * `groupby ()` = field <br>
  * `calculate (:)` = function:field

  #### Try it out
  Test these queries in Log Search and see the results for yourself.

  * where(result ISTARTS-WITH "failed" AND logon_type!=NETWORK)groupby(destination_user, destination_asset)limit(5, 1)
  * where(action=MEMBER_ADDED_TO_SECURITY_GROUP AND group IIN [admin, desktop, network, support, "service accounts"])groupby(source_user, target_account, group)
  * where(source_account==target_account)groupby(action, source_user))

  To save a query for future use, click the ellipsis next to the **Run** button and select **Save Query**.

  See <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/log-search" target="_blank">Log Search</a> for more information.

</details>

<details><summary>Visualize your data with dashboards</summary>

 Dashboards allow you to build custom views of the data you want to monitor. As a starting point, either create a new dashboard or use an existing dashboard. Add, edit, resize, and rearrange the data visualization cards to tailor the data view to your needs.

#### Explore the IT Operations Dashboard
 
  The IT Operations Dashboard offers a high level view of Weekly Account Lockouts and Unlocks, Most Active admin accounts on user accounts. Most Active admin accounts on their own accounts, Top 5 Directory groups by most membership adds, and more. 

  The IT Operations Dashboard is populated by data sent from **Active Directory**, **Firewall**, **VPN**, and **Cloud Service** event sources. To take advantage of this dashboard, be sure those event sources have been set up.
  * **Active Directory** event sources send Active Directory Admin Activity, Asset Authentication and Raw log data.
  * **Firewall** and **VPN** event sources send Firewall Activity and Ingress Authentication logs.
  * **Cloud Service** event source send Ingress Authentication logs.

**To set up the IT Operations Dashboard** 

  1. From the Product left menu, click **Dashboards and Reports**.
  2. From the dashboard list, click the **Dashboard Library** button. The Dashboard Library modal appears.
  3. Search for the **IT Operations Dashboard** and click **Add**.

</details>

<details><summary>Understand deception technology</summary>

Some types of stealthy behavior can be difficult to discern from normal activity, allowing the attacker to sneak past your security tools and into your organization undetected. Placing intruder traps as a way to distract attackers can often help you find attackers earlier and take action to block them before they access something they should not.

#### Review Honey Items

Company Honey Items, a type of intruder trap, can attract hackers because they are “sweet” with opportunity. The most common type of intruder trap is a honeypot, which is a decoy system designed to gather information about attackers on your network. It can help you learn how attackers are accessing your systems.

 Product has four kinds of deception traps that you can configure and deploy. Attempted access or use of these intruder traps triggers <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honey-alerts" target="_blank">Honey Alerts</a> in Product. We recommend deploying deception traps in this recommended order:

  1. <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honeypot" target="_blank">Honeypots</a>: Deploy these to cover as much network as possible (for instance, one for each subnet).
  2. <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honey-users" target="_blank">Honey Users</a>: Add a user to the Active Directory that matches how you typically configure usernames, but also conveys it may be a domain admin.
  3. <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honey-files" target="_blank">Honey Files</a>: Deploy files that appear to be valuable, such as a financial report or something with personally identifiable information (PII).
  4. <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honey-credentials" target="_blank">Honey Credentials</a>: These are managed by Company on the Agent so no setup is required.
   
#### Configure a honeypot

  A honeypot is a virtual server that you can deploy on your network from Product. Honeypots can look like any other machine on the network, or they can be deployed to look like something an attacker could target. You can have a single honeypot or multiple honeypots, and you can deploy them straight out of Product. Honeypots lie in wait for “attacker” events to happen, such as a port scan or attempted user authentication, which immediately sets off an alarm. If you deploy the Company Honeypot and enable the associated detection rules in Product, you will be notified if such activity occurs. Once attackers find an initial foothold in a network, their next step is typically a network scan to identify all the other assets in the network.

  Product's Honeypot is an OVA appliance designed for deployment in VMware environments. The honeypot can detect network reconnaissance, typically in the form of suspicious network or port scanning. The Honeypot OVA contains an appliance that is able to listen on all ports. All scanning or connection attempts are allowed. Each time a connection is attempted, the honeypot captures information about the source asset, and potential user associated with the connection. This data is immediately pushed up to the Insight platform, generating a <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honey-alerts" target="_blank">Honeypot Access Alert</a>.

 **How to configure a honeypot**

  1. From the Product homepage, click **Data Collection** on the left menu.
  2.  In the top right corner, click **Setup Honeypot** and select **Download Honeypot**.

  The **Honeypot OVA** download will begin automatically. See <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/honeypot#download-a-honeypot" target="_blank">Download a Honeypot</a> for next steps.

## Days 46 - 90: Optimize for Success
Configure basic detection rules (formerly known as custom alerts), create custom dashboards, and create automation workflows to tailor Product to your environment's unique needs.

<details><summary>Configure Basic Detection Rules</summary>

  With Product, you have the option of creating basic detection rules when built-in rules do not suit your needs. You configure basic detection rules in Log Search. Basic detection rules can be created manually, or configured to auto-populate. You can always switch to a different rule type during configuration. There are three kinds of basic detection rules.
  
  #### Log Inactivity Detection Rules
  Also known as “Up Down Monitoring”, inactivity rules can be used to notify you when an entire log, log group, or particular pattern becomes inactive for a given time period.
  
For setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#auto-populate-a-log-inactivity-detection-rule" target="_blank">Auto-populate a Log Inactivity Detection Rule</a> or <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#manually-configure-a-log-inactivity-detection-rule" target="_blank">Manually configure a Log Inactivity Detection Rule</a>.
  
  #### Log Pattern Detection Rules
   In order for a detection to trigger, a log must match the exact pattern you enter as a search term. Detecting on patterns can be useful in situations such as monitoring server errors, critical exceptions, and general performance, and allows you to only monitor events that are important to you.

For setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#auto-populate-a-log-pattern-detection-rule" target="_blank">Auto-populate a Log Pattern Detection Rule</a> or <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#manually-create-a-log-pattern-detection-rule" target="_blank">Manually create a Log Pattern Detection Rule</a>.
  
  #### Log Change Detection Rules
  Log change detection rules will notify you when a condition changes, such as HTTP 500 errors in your web access logs. They are based on calculations that you apply to **logs** or **log sets**.

For setup instructions, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#auto-populate-a-log-change-detection-rule" target="_blank">Auto-populate a log Change Detection Rule</a> or <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/create-and-manage-basic-detection-rules#manually-configure-a-log-change-detection-rule" target="_blank">Manually configure a Log Change Detection Rule</a>.

</details>

<details><summary>Customize your dashboards</summary>

  Product's dashboards are customizable to ensure your views of your environment meet your needs. While it's easier to customize a dashboard template, you can also create a new one from scratch. Although dashboard customization is up to you, we'd like to share some key elements to explore while building your dashboards.

  #### Edit the cards
  After adding a card to your dashboard, click the gear icon in the top right corner of a card and select **Edit**.

  1. **Name Card** : Change the card's name and description to provide more clarity from the dashboard view.
  2. **Select Data Source** : 
     - Use a previously saved query and customize the **Full Query** to show the data you want to highlight.
     - Change the time range for the data shown in the card.
     - Change the log set the card's data is referencing.
  3. **Configure Chart** : Add a caption, add data labels, change the scale, and change the colors of your card
     - **Captions** are a free text form to provide additional context of the card's data from the dashboard view. 
     - **Colors** are best for differentiating between multiple groups in one card. Try editing the colors of a Stacked Bar chart!
  4. **Switch Charts** : You can choose the best way to visualize your card's data from the charts listed in the **Switch Charts** section. Product will only make the charts available that can correctly display your data. 

  [block:callout]

  3. Enter a Dashboard Name and Description. The Description is optional, but it helps differentiate all of the dashboards at your organization.
  4. Click the **Create Dashboard** button.

  Now that you’ve saved your new dashboard, it’s available in the dashboard list. To add data visualization cards to your dashboard, you’ve been directed to the Card Library. You can find, add, and customize cards for your dashboard. If you can’t find a card you want in the Card Library, build your own in the Card Builder.

  See <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/dashboards-and-reports#add-cards-to-your-dashboard" target="_blank">Dashboard Cards</a> to learn how to customize your cards. 

</details>

<details><summary>Get started with automation</summary>

  Automation can greatly improve the efficiency of your team by tackling security issues as they emerge in your environment. Automatically containing threats, quickly notifying your team of suspicious activity, and tracking the progress of an investigation are just three of the ways that automation can help to streamline your security processes. 

  To take advantage of automation, you must install the Insight Orchestrator and configure automation connections. Once the Orchestrator is set up, you can explore our out-of-the-box workflow templates and use automation to enrich your investigations.

#### Automation core concepts

  Review these automation core concepts to understand how to successfully apply automation across your detection, investigation, and response tasks.

  * **Orchestrator**: The Insight Orchestrator is an on-premise technological component that aids connection between your environment and the cloud.
  * **Connections**: Connections enable two-way communication between Product and third-party products, solutions, and tools. They are comprised of 2 parts: **Plugins** are the third-party integration sources with defined automation triggers and actions, while **credentials** are the sensitive secrets that enable authentication into a third-party source.
  * **Workflows**: Workflows are automated processes designed to quickly work through key tasks across detection, investigation, and response. They can be completely automated, or have human decision steps along the way so a member of your team can provide necessary context when it's needed most. Workflows can also be simple one-off actions, or a complex tree of orchestrated steps.
  * **Triggers**: Instead of requiring manual action, Triggers will automatically initiate a workflow in response to a security event. Triggers are currently available for legacy detection rules only.

#### How to set up automation

<details><summary>Step 1: Install and Activate the Insight Orchestrator</summary>

 The Insight Orchestrator is a component installed on your network that gives Product the access it needs to automate security processes. You must have an orchestrator if you want to take advantage of the Automation features available in Product.

  1. From the Product left menu, click Data Collection. 
  2. Click the Orchestrators tab, click Install Orchestrator, and follow the on-screen prompts. 
  InsightConnect uses plugins to give you access to a wide variety of capabilities, from data manipulation to response actions. The Insight Orchestrator uses Docker containers to run individual plugins.

  }
  [/block]

  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Step 2: Configure automation connections</summary>
  Product includes several out-of-the-box Workflow Templates built for third-party tools that you can leverage for your security needs. In order to use these templates, you’ll need to set up Automation Connections. A connection comprises the credentials and required parameters, such as the application URL, that Product needs to access and authenticate to a third-party tool.

#### Task 1: Find Connection Requirements
  
Product currently supports automation for the following third-party integrations:

* Active Directory
* Cb Response
* JIRA
* Okta
* ServiceNow

#### Task 3: Create a Credential
    
  Most connections require a credential for use. Credential types include API keys, username/password pairs, and other sensitive information that is encrypted at rest and in transit. Credentials are saved separately from connections so that they may be reused across multiple connections as needed. Credentials used in your connections are encrypted on the Orchestrator itself. For more information about credential security, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/insightconnect/orchestrator/#orchestrator-security" target="_blank">Orchestrator Security</a>.

  1. Click on the **Choose a Credential** input in the connection configuration menu and select **Create New Credential**. 
  2. Enter a display name for your credential, then enter the credential itself. 
  3. Click **Save** and proceed with your connection configuration.

  For more information on editing credentials and using existing connections, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/insightconnect/create-a-connection" target="_blank">InsightConnect Create a Connection</a>.

  <details><summary>Step 3: Create a workflow from a template</summary>

Workflows are available for you to kick off when there is something in your investigation that requires you to take action.
You can use out-of-the-box workflow templates to set up Workflows that do things like quarantine an asset, suspend a user account from within an investigation, and create JIRA tickets. These Workflows are based on Workflow Templates. These templates are workflows that do not have configured connections and are handy when you need to reuse Workflow steps with different connections. 

#### Create your first workflow 
After you’ve installed an Orchestrator, we recommend starting with the **Open Source Alert Enrichment workflow** to contextualize your investigations and alerts.
  1. Open the Investigation where you’d like to add automation and click **Take Action**.
  2. Click **Enrichment Workflows** from the _Select an Action_ category.
  3. Click **Enrich Alert Data with Open Source Plugins** from the _Select and Automation Action to Take_ dropdown.
  4. Follow the instructions to name your workflow, select connections, and configure details.
  5. Click **Take Action** to launch your workflow.

To configure other workflow templates, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/activate-workflow-templates" target="_blank">Automation Workflow Templates</a>.
  </details>

  <details><summary>Step 4: Use a workflow in an investigation</summary>

  To begin using automation workflows to streamline your investigations, try an **<a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/automated-enrichment-workflows" target="_blank">Automated Enrichment Workflow</a>**. Product offers built-in enrichment workflow templates that you can configure. 

  These workflows can process and enrich the following input data types:
  * Asset
  * Domain
  * IP Address
  * Process
  * URL
  * User

  Most enrichment workflow templates are capable of processing four or more of these data types from the same investigation, but Product does not require all data types to be present in order for the workflow to run. As long as any enrichment workflow has viable input to process, it will return enriched content for your security teams to use. 

  Enrichment workflows rely on several third party and open source plugins to process your investigation data; ensure you have installed and activated an Insight Orchestrator.

<details><summary>Enable File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)</summary>

  File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) allows you to audit changes to critical files and folders for compliance reasons on Windows systems running agent version 2.5.3.8 or later.

  When you turn on FIM, the Insight Agent starts collecting FIM events. Product can then attribute users to file modification activity. You can create alerts based on certain file log events to notify you when one of your users modifies a critical file or folder.

 #### How to configure FIM
  * Review the <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/file-integrity-monitoring#windows-requirements" target="_blank">Windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/fim-for-linux" target="_blank">Linux</a> requirements.
  * <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/file-integrity-monitoring#turn-it-on-in-Product" target="_blank">Turn on FIM</a> in Product.
  * Follow the configuration steps for a <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/file-integrity-monitoring#configure-fim-in-your-assets-in-windows" target="_blank">Windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/fim-for-linux#configure-auditd-compatibility-mode" target="_blank">Linux</a> environment.

<details><summary>Deploy the Network Sensor</summary>

 During your first 45 days, you deployed Insight Agents and Collectors to monitor your assets for vulnerabilities and user behavior. While these components are responsible for collecting data on your assets, they do not account for network traffic, which is the data moving between your assets. To provide the network traffic visibility that you need for **network traffic analysis (NTA)**, Company offers the <a href="https://docs.Company.com/sensor/" target="_blank">Insight Network Sensor</a> with multiple deployment options.

  The Insight Network Sensor allows you to monitor, capture, and assess the end-to-end network traffic moving throughout your physical and virtual environment. Product can then leverage this network sensor data for network traffic analysis and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) detection rules.

  #### Network Sensor deployment options

  There are 3 options for deploying the network sensor. All options offer network traffic visibility, but are deployed and configured differently.

  * The Insight Network Sensor deployed on a physical server
  * The Insight Network Sensor deployed on a virtual machine
  * The Insight Network Sensor for AWS, which is deployed on an EC2 instance
  
  To deploy an Insight Network Sensor, see the <a href="https://docs.Company.com/sensor/insight-network-sensor-deployment-guide" target="_blank">Insight Network Sensor Deployment Guide</a>.

</details>

<details><summary>How IDS detection rules work</summary>

  Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an application that monitors for malicious activity and policy violations on your network. When configuring this event source in Product, the IDS data is attributed to the user and asset details page and allows you to search through the data. However, it does not produce alerts.

  Product can collect events from these types of IDS/IPS devices:

  * Cisco FirePower
  * Corero IPS
  * Dell iSensor
  * F5 Networks BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager
  * HP TippingPoint
  * Juniper Junos
  * McAfee IDS
  * Metaflows IDS
  * Security Onion
  * Sentinel IPS
  * Snort IDS
  * Network Sensor

  To collect IDS/IPS events, you need to configure the device to send syslog to the Collector.  For a detailed list of the rules used to identify suspicious activity, see <a href="https://docs.Company.com/Product/suspicious-network-activity" target="_blank">IDS detection rules powered by the Insight Network Sensor</a>.
